# stresc - "String Escape"

    go get github.com/thejerf/stresc

A library for interpolating strings in the manner I propose to be more
correct than the usual manners.

This code is posted in support of a blog post, which I recommend reading in
order to understand the design and the purpose of the design. At the
moment, I wouldn't particularly propose that you use it in real code; I
don't. After all this represents ~4 hours of screwing around rather than
something I'd ship directly. However, it does do what it does, so if you
are moved to use it, I won't object. As the LICENSE says, if it breaks you
get to keep both pieces. If enough pull requests come in to turn this into
a real library I won't complain.
